# Lattice Gauge Theory in 2D without Fermion Content

This repository includes the Python codes for Simulation of 2D Lattice Gauge Theory with 1 space and 1 time dimention. It demonstrate how to code for different values of N (e.g., SU(2), SU(3), SU(4)). Following are the fundamental steps in th Simulation:
